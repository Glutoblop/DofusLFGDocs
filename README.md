No longer will spamming /r to hope someone else can see your requests for help. Now just schedule an event for the time you will be on, and anyone else who is available at that time can hop in and join you!   

## Registering To DofusLFG
There are 2 steps to using DofusLFG, the first step is to use the `/register` command, this will tell DofusLFG that your discord account exists.

  After this we have an optional process of *Linking* your Discord account to each Ankama account you have Dofus Characters on.    

      // IMPORTANT - NOTICE 
      This process does not require you to give DofusLFG any of your Ankama/Dofus login information.  
      If anyone ever asks for your login information they are only trying to steal your accounts. 
      Never give your account information away.  

Ankama do not provide an API, the only way for us to confirm that you own the Ankama account you are telling us  you own is to get you to add a unique code, DofusLFG walks you through this process:

Account Linking might be enforced inside different Discords because it allows anyone to look up a Discord members Dofus Characters to make sure they are who they say they are:
