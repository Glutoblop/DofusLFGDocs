## 

Organise ingame Dofus activities with your Discord community, set the time, details and description of the type of help you want. 
Let other Discord members jump in to help you out.    
  
No longer will spamming /r to hope someone else can see your requests for help. Now just schedule an event for the time you will be on, and anyone else who is available at that time can hop in and join you!   

### Bot Versions: Full Package and Lite
The bot supports 2 ways it can help you manage your Dofus Discord community, **Full Package** or **Lite**.
### Lite
This is a barebones approach to DofusLFG and will allow you to customise how the bot interacts with your Discord server while at the same time giving the bot no additional permissions to access your Discord server.  
This is best for larger Discord servers that just want to be able to dedicate 1 easy to use channel where you can communicate with the Bot, no mess no fuss.  
Features Included:
* Creating events in the designated channel (determined by you)
* Reminder messages to all members who sign up to the event of its start time.
* (Optional) Commendations to your teammates after Events have been completed.
* (Optional) Linking Ankama Account to Discord

  ### Full Package 
The **Full Package** is DofusLFG with all its featured and tries to take the burden off of you when setting up the required channels and roles to manage the Events. This does come with the drawback of allowing the bot more permissions so it can handle managing channels and roles it creates when you set it up.   
It does everything that **Lite** does but it creates and manages the LFG channels and roles for you, so you don't have to.    
Full Package Features Include everything in Lite, plus:
* Role Management, to receive notifications for Events that you are interested in.
* Automatic Voice Channel creation for each event, which is then automatically deleted once its no longer needed.
* Automatic Channel Setup from a single command for Dofus2, DofusTouch or DofusRetro.

## Registering To DofusLFG
There are 2 steps to using DofusLFG, the first step is to use the `/register` command, this will tell DofusLFG that your discord account exists.

  After this we have an optional process of *Linking* your Discord account to each Ankama account you have Dofus Characters on.    

      // IMPORTANT - NOTICE 
      This process does not require you to give DofusLFG any of your Ankama/Dofus login information.  
      If anyone ever asks for your login information they are only trying to steal your accounts. 
      Never give your account information away.  

Ankama do not provide an API, the only way for us to confirm that you own the Ankama account you are telling us  you own is to get you to add a unique code, DofusLFG walks you through this process:

Account Linking might be enforced inside different Discords because it allows anyone to look up a Discord members Dofus Characters to make sure they are who they say they are:

## Creating Events

Start the process of creating an event by entering the `/createevent` command on a Discord with DofusLFG active inside the specified Dofus server and language channel provided. eg. `DOFUSLFG TAL KASHA #lfg-events-en` to start an English event for the Dofus Server Tal Kasha.

Then follow the steps to build the event you want!

 When do you want to start your event? Using the `'/register'` command you can specify your current TimeZone relative to UTC. You can see your difference between UTC from [HERE](https://www.worldtimeserver.com/current_time_in_UTC.aspx)
