No longer will spamming /r to hope someone else can see your requests for help. Now just schedule an event for the time you will be on, and anyone else who is available at that time can hop in and join you!   

## Creating Events

Start the process of creating an event by entering the `/createevent` command on a Discord with DofusLFG active.
